# Classifying Diabetes in Pima Indian Women

## Abstract

For this project, binary classification was performed using various machine learning models to predict if a person had diabetes. After the data was cleaned and scaled, features were created. A 75-25 test-train-split was done and Logistic Regressioin, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were used. The algorithms with the highest accuracies and F1 scores were Random Forest and XGBoost.
