# Classifying Diabetes in Pima Indian Women

## Abstract

For this project, binary classification was performed using various machine learning models to predict if a person had diabetes. After the data was cleaned and scaled, features were created. A 75-25 test-train-split was done and Logistic Regressioin, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were used. The algorithms with the highest accuracies and F1 scores were Random Forest and XGBoost. 

## The Data
The data was retrieved from Kaggle. The dataset is originally from National Institude of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The data looks specifically at attributes of women over the age of 21 that are of Pima Indian heritage. The original dataset includes the following columns:
- Glucose
